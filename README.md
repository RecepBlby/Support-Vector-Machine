# Support Vector Machine

Supervised learning is when you train a machine learning model using labelled data. It means that you have data that already have the right classification associated with them. One common use of supervised learning is to help you predict values for new data.

Unsupervised learning is when you train a model with unlabeled data. This means that the model will have to find its own features and make predictions based on how it classifies the data.

An algorithm is just a customizable math function. That's why most algorithms have things like cost functions, weight values, and parameter functions that you can interchange based on the data you're working with. At its core, machine learning is just a bunch of math equations that need to be solved really fast.

Support vector machines are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. All of these are common tasks in machine learning.You can use them to detect cancerous cells based on millions of images or you can use them to predict future driving routes with a well-fitted regression model.
